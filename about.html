    <p>
      This site started as a sample project for the <strong>awesome</strong> Git
      tutorial <em>Learn Enough™ Git to Be Dangerous</em>. 
      <br>
      I started this website during my trip to Kalymnos September/October 2018. I am going to use this website as my first project to explore and learn skills for website development.
